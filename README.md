# Resume
This is the code for my personal resume website. It is an example of what can be done with an angular frontend alongside a light weight backend. 

It is also a demonstration of how I handle website development over time.  Github will be used so that previous versions of my entire project can be seen as needed. Anyone will be able to go through the commit history and see everything develop step by step if they wish.

## Current features
The website can now be found hosted at http://philip-resume.duckdns.org:3000. 
The current Feature list can be found in the [Features](Features.md) file.

## Planned Features

## Hosting
A [deploy](Deploy.md) document has been created to help people setup and run the website locally for development.
