# Features
The website now meets the basic requirments to be delivered in the modern day.

## The website is now fully reactive. 
The user experience of the website must be pleasent both on mobile and on computers. People hiring and looking for candidates will likely be doing so from personal computer. Meanwhile most people have a mobile phone in thier possesion and the vast majority of modern phones are capable of accessing the web from anywhere. 

This means that a modern website must support all screen sizes from small phone screens to ultra wide monitors.

## Content are pulled from a database
The website is suppose to be an online version of my resume and will need to have all its contents within it.

This will include sections for any relevant work experience, education, personal contact information, skills and so on. 

Finally this content must be displayed in positive way. A plain text resume as a website will not be very attractive. Styling will be applied as nessecary and in a way that will change based on screen size and device type. No matter the device or screen size or screen resolution, the content must be easy to navigate, easy to understand and a positive experience for the user.

## Ways to easily edit and change the website are implemented
This will be one of the main draws of this project and what will demonstrate the needs for a backend to go with a front end. A simple website made with just angular could do everything already listed. However to make it possible to edit the contents of a website without the aid of a developer, a backend of some sort is nessesary weather your using amazon web services or a dedicated backend like this project.

If a user is an administrator they need to be able to log in, they need to be able to view the contents of the website and edit them as desired. They will need to be able to add contents to the website in case of more experiences or skills, they might need to remove or edit outdated expereinces as things change and so on.

All admin pages will also need to be fully reactive in case they need to access the website while away from a PC. 

This has been implmented through an express server.
