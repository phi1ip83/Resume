Angular will be used as a framework to make it easy to manage and re-use code as needed. Angular will also make it possible to test individual pieces of the front end and prevent errors in the process of development.

Bootstrap is a bundle of CSS and javascript made to easily style any hmtl you might want to make and to add many common behaviors to sites. It also makes it a lot easier to creat fully reactive web pages, fit for any screen size.
