#Development Environment
## Visual Studio Code
Both the frontend and the backend will be developed along side each other with Visual Studio Code, a popular code editor with a large range of extensions and plug-ins. Some of the extensions were used specificly to make running the backend in production far easier then they otherwise would be.

## Postman
Postman was used to test any changes made in the backend by simplifying the sending and recieving of information without needing to make or edit webpages, something that can take far too much time when in active development.

In postman it also allows you to save any requests made to your backend so you can come back later and easily re-test any changes without having to make the entire request from scratch. This allows you to test individual requests from a server without deleting previous requests like you would if using a web browser and a front end to test.

## LibreWolf and Brave
LibreWolf and the Brave Browser were the primary web browsers used to test the website while it was being developed. Brave is based off of the google chrome web browser while LibreWolf is based off of Fire Fox. 

Brave was used instead of google chrome because it functions in the same manner while having additional restrictions on the content within. many other popular web browsers like microsoft Edge are also based off of google chrome and function identically. Over 65% of all web browsers used are either google chrome or based on it world wide.

LibreWolf was used instead of FireFox because it is very privacy based and blocks a large amount of javascript and web tools like WebGL. Anyone who has modified thier web browsers because they want privacy will likely block similiar things, this way I can ensure even those individuals can access my website. Firefox is the only web browser other then chrome that is commonly used as a base. This lets me cover a slightly wider range of web browsers as well. 

The one weakness is the lack of support for safari. Safari is a browser made for apple products and will have to be throughly tested once development nears completion. Any future work will also have to be tested in case of issues.
