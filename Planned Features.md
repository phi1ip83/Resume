# Planned Features
The following are planned features and not implemented.
- The ability to save or print a fully formatted word document based on what the user selects. This will include option like number of pages that are accaptable, desired font size, line spacing and so on.
- The ability to take in a resume doc and create fields based on it.
- Additional pages to display any other products or websites I make in the future. Eventually the goal is to turn my resume website into a personal portfolio that can be accessed anywhere.
